# BarnSense: AI & IoT Livestock Health Monitoring

BarnSense is an innovative project that harnesses the power of AI and IoT to monitor the health of livestock, with potential applications in wildlife monitoring. This repository contains the complete working code behind the device.

## Overview

BarnSense aims to provide a comprehensive solution for monitoring the health of cattle by combining artificial intelligence and Internet of Things technologies. By analyzing various parameters, it can detect potential health issues early, allowing for timely intervention and improved animal welfare.

## Getting Started

To get started with BarnSense, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create an account on Twilio and obtain your credentials.
4. Replace the Twilio credentials in the code to enable alert notifications.

## Usage

Before running the code, ensure you have set up the Twilio credentials as mentioned above. Once configured, you can run the main script to start monitoring livestock health. Make sure to keep the `doc.html` file in a separate folder named `templates` for proper functioning.

## Folder Structure

- `/src`: Contains the source code files.
- `/templates`: Holds the HTML template files (keep `doc.html` here).
